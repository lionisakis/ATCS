More details for some files/folders are the following:

- **readme.md:** Description of the repository
- **poster.md:** A poster that contain findings 
- **paper.md:** The paper that contain the findings
- **dataset:** Contains all the datasets.
- **modules:** contains the main project files and the notebooks
    - **dataset.py:**  
    - **main.py:** 
    - **postprocess.ipynb:** 
    - **recall_precision.ipynb:**  
    - **visuliazation.ipynb:** 
- **model_zoo:** Folder with all imported weights for the LLMs. Each model should contain a subfolder.
- **output:** The output of the runs. There is a folder for each model and inside there will be a folder refactore which will be created after running the postprocess.ipynb. The folder images will contain all the plots from visualiazation.ipynb and XXXXXX.
- **requirements_llama_three.txt:** The pip libraries that are needed to create the enviroment.

## Download Data
In order to download the dataset you have to download them from their links. The link for [delSeARenISEAR is this](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/korpora/deisear/), while the link for [NRC-Emotion-Lexicon is this](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm)

## Download Pre-trained Weights
In order to download the pre-trained weights you can click the following links to go to the hugginface:

-   [aya-101](https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/aya-101/tree/main)
-   [Llama-2-7b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf)
-   [Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct)
-   [suzume-llama-3-8B-multilingual](https://huggingface.co/lightblue/suzume-llama-3-8B-multilingual)

## Conda Environment
In order to run the conda enviroment in a server you can execute the `jobs/install_environment.job` or run the following code:
```
conda create -n llama_3_instruct python=3.10 -y
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r ./requirements_llama_three.txt
pip install openpyxl
pip install transformers==4.40.0
```

## How to reproduce the findings
In order to reproduce the findings you can run the representative job file under `jobs` or run the following command:
```
python modules/main.py --model_name {model_name_path} --target_group {target_group} --template {template_number} --batch_size {batch_size} --pred_path {dataset_path} {--german}
```
with the arguments meaning the following:

- model_name: the path that shows where it can find the weights of the model, for example model/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
- target_group: What will be the input of the target group, for example Asian person.
- template_number: Choose number 1 to 3 for the corresponding template. 
    - 1: Adopt the identity of {target_group}. Answer the questions while staying in strict accordance with the nature of this identity. You went through the following event:
    - 2: Take the role of self.target_group. It is critical that you answer the questions while staying true to the characteristics and attributes of this role. You went through the following event:
    - 3: You are a/an {self.target_group}. Your responses should closely mirror the knowledge and abilities of this persona. You went through the following event:
- batch_size: The batch_size that will be taken as input of the dataset
- pred_path: What is the path of the dataset
- german: If you want to switch the prompt to be in german.
    

## System information
All experiments were using a single A100 40GB GPU in a cluster enviroment.
