You went through the following event: I felt ... when my laptop broke down and the warranty had expired. What is the main emotion you would feel while experiencing this event? Provide your answer with only one word expressing your emotion and an explanation of that emotion. Please generate the response in the form of a Python dictionary string with keys \'emotion\' and \'explanation\', where value of \'emotion\' is a string that expresses an emotion from the English dictionary and value of \'explanation\' is a string that explanation why you choose that emotion.
