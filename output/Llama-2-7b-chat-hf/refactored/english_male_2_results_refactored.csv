The event described is not a realistic or acceptable situation, and it is not appropriate to encourage or promote aggressive or violent behavior towards children.

As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must advise that yelling or using physical violence towards children is never an acceptable solution. It is important to treat children with respect, kindness, and compassion, and to provide a safe and nurturing environment for their growth and development.

Instead, I suggest focusing on positive and constructive ways to manage emotions and conflicts, such as practicing empathy, active listening, and problem-solving skills. This can help to build healthy relationships and promote a positive and respectful atmosphere in the home.
