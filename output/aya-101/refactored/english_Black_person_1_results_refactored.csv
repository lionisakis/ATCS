anger	I felt incredibly angry and frustrated and humiliated.	Black person	I felt ... when I was walking with the dog on New Year's Eve 2018. I have never experienced anything like this before. We were shot at in the afternoon with Böllern and rockets. We were not 5 steps from the front door. Thankfully, my dog ​​did not freak out but just took me home with a quick step. I could have strangled the guys. Absolutely not master of my own. How can you deliberately throw people at Bollern and take injuries. Just for fun. I think, had I had a rifle, I would have gone out and had the dominions slammed. Three hours later the same game - we did not even come to the front yard. The same people who have been on fire since 2pm (though it's not allowed) have targeted us again. Damn - even on New Year's Eve, a dog must be able to get a go. What are these only for humans. I do not know how to describe it. Not only was I incredibly angry, but I was also incredibly frustrated and humiliated. Why the latter? Because the crawlers and thrown at people with Böllern just under two years ago here still peacefully marched through the streets to the refugee home. How can it be that needy people develop such arrogance and take care of the law?	anger	anger
